# DTItimingdemo

## FSL

The demo requires installation of FSL, which is restrictively licensed - specifically, unlike free software, you do not have the right to modify or distribute the software. It is also restricted to non-commercial use. 
It's also about a 4GB download. 


This script was tested on FSL 6.0.3, installing to Ubuntu 19.04. 

Installing in default location: /usr/local/fsl

## Script

The script uses `eddy_correct`, which has now been superseded by the superior `eddy`.
